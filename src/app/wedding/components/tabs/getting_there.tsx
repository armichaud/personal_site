      Regardless of your travel plans, contact us when you have determined when
      and how you&apos;ll arrive. We can help you arrange transportation offered
      by the venue from certain points of entry. The most convenient option
      would be the Florence Airport, Peretola (FLR). We can also arrange for you
      to be picked up from the airports in Pisa (PSA) or Bologna (BLQ), but the
      ride will be more expensive.

      Another option would be to fly into Rome (FCO) and take a train to
      Florence. Many budget airlines fly to Rome, the trains to Florence are
      inexpensive, and we can arrange for pickup from Santa Maria Novella
      station. Trains in Italy are generally affordable, so you might also
      consider arriving by train if you are traveling in Italy beforehand. If
      you have rented a car, there is free parking on-site at the venue. The
      castle is approximately a half hour drive from Florence.

      Transportation arranged through the venue must be paid in euros, but we
      will be able to minimize costs to guests by grouping those arriving at
      similar times from the same point of entry. We do not recommend arranging
      a private taxi or uber to the castle. They will be more expensive and will
      not be able to take you directly to the villa in which you are staying.
      Let us save you the trouble of bringing your bags up the hill!
