        Making the journey to Italy is more than we could ever expect from our
        guests, so please do not feel obligated to give us anything more. The
        greatest gift we can receive is your presence on our special day.

        We recently purchased our dream home, so if you are inclined to give us
        something, we would greatly appreciate contributions toward the cost of
        furnishings, repairs, and upkeep. Those with Venmo can click or scan the
        QR code below, or else we would happily accept anything directly in
        Florence (lluvia de sobres, como dir√≠an en Colombia).
